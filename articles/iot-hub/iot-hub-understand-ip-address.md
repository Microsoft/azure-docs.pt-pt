# <a name="iot-hub-ip-addresses"></a>IoT Hub IP addresses

The IP address prefixes of IoT hub are published periodically under the *AzureIoTHub* [service tag](../virtual-network/service-tags-overview.md). To ensure proper operation, your IoT devices must have outbound connectivity to address prefixes listed under *AzureIoTHub* service tag. Your IoT application services need to additionally have outbound connectivity to address prefixes listed under *EventHub* service tag.


## <a name="best-practices"></a>Melhores pr√°ticas

* The IP address prefixes of IoT hub are subject to change. These changes are published periodically via service tags before taking effect. It is therefore important that you develop processes to regularly retrieve and use the latest service tags. This process can be automated via the [service tags discovery API](../virtual-network/service-tags-overview.md#service-tags-in-on-premises).
* Use the *AzureIoTHub.[region name]* tag to identify IP prefixes used by IoT hub endpoints in a specific region. To account for datacenter disaster recovery, or [regional failover](iot-hub-ha-dr.md) ensure connectivity to IP prefixes of your IoT Hub's geo-pair region is also enabled.

IPv6 is currently not supported on IoT Hub.
