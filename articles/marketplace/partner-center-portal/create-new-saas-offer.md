# <a name="create-a-new-saas-offer"></a>Create a new SaaS offer

To begin creating Software as a Service (SaaS) offers, ensure that you first [Create a Partner Center account](./create-account.md) and open the [Commercial Marketplace dashboard](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/commercial-marketplace/offers), with the **Overview** tab selected.

![Commercial Marketplace dashboard on Partner Center](./media/new-offer-overview.png)

>[!Note]
> Once an offer has been published, edits to the offer made in Partner Center will only be updated in the system and store fronts after re-publishing. Please ensure that you submit the offer for publication after you make changes.

Select the + **New offerâ€¦** button, then select the **Software as a Service** menu item. 

If you select another offer type, you may be redirected to the older [Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com/). Only SaaS and Dynamics 365 offers are available in the Commercial Marketplace portal on Partner Center at this time.

![Create offer window on Partner Center](./media/new-offer-click.png)

The **New offer** dialog box is displayed. 

![New offer dialog box](./media/new-offer-popup.png)

## <a name="offer-id-and-alias"></a>Offer ID and alias

- **Offer ID**: Unique identifier for each offer in your account. This ID will be visible to customers in the URL address for the marketplace offer and Azure Resource Manager templates (if applicable). Offer ID must be lowercase, alphanumeric (including hyphens and underscores, but no whitespace). This is limited to 50 characters and can't be changed after you select *Create*.  
Example: test-offer-1
<br>Resulting in the URL: `https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/../test-offer-1`

- **Offer alias**: The name used to refer to the offer within the Partner Center portal. This name won't be used in the marketplace and is different than the *Offer Name* and other values that will be shown to customers. This value can't be changed after you select *Create*.

<br>Example: Test Offer 1&#8482;

Selecione **Criar**.  An **Offer overview** page is created for this offer.  

<!---
![Offer overview on Partner Center](./media/commercial-marketplace-offer-overview.png)
-->

## <a name="offer-overview"></a>Offer overview

The **Offer overview** page includes: 

- The **Publishing status** displays a visual representation of the steps required to publish this offer and how long each step will take to complete. Incomplete publishing step icons will be greyed out. 

- The **Offer overview** menu contains a list of links for performing operations on this offer. This list of operations will change based on the selection you make for your offer.  
    - If the offer is a draft - Delete draft 
    - If the offer is live - Stop sell offer 
    - If the offer is in preview - Go-live 
    - If you haven't completed publisher sign out - Cancel publish

## <a name="offer-setup"></a>Offer setup

The **Offer setup** tab asks for the following information. Select **Save** after completing these fields.

- **Would you like to sell through Microsoft?** (Yes/No)
    - **Yes**, you would like to sell your offer through Microsoft, with Microsoft hosting marketplace transactions on your behalf; or 
    - **No**, you would prefer to just list your offer through the marketplaces, processing any monetary transactions independently of Microsoft.    

### <a name="sell-through-microsoft"></a>Sell through Microsoft

Selling through Microsoft provides better customer discovery and acquisition, allows Microsoft to host marketplace transactions on your behalf, and takes advantage of Microsoft's globally available commerce capabilities.

#### <a name="saas-offer-requirements"></a>SaaS offer requirements

In order to list Software as a Service (SaaS) offers with Commercial Marketplace on Partner Center, the following criteria must be met:

- Your offer must use [Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory/) for identity management and authentication.
- Your offer must use [SaaS Fulfillment APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/pc-saas-fulfillment-api-v2) to integrate with the Azure Marketplace.
- For more extensive requirements, see the [SaaS Offer Publishing Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/marketplace-saas-applications-technical-publishing-guide).

#### <a name="saas-pricing-and-billing-options"></a>SaaS pricing and billing options
With SaaS solutions running in the publisher's Azure subscription, license fees paid by customers include the cost of the infrastructure upon which the software is deployed. Azure infrastructure usage is managed and billed to you, the partner, directly. Actual infrastructure usage fees are not seen by the customer. Publishers should bundle Azure infrastructure usage fees into their software license pricing. 

SaaS offers support monthly or annual billing based on a flat fee, per user, or consumption charges using the metered billing service. Microsoft's commercial marketplace operates on an agency model, whereby publishers set prices, Microsoft bills customers, and Microsoft pays revenue to the publisher while withholding an agency fee.

The following table shows an example break down of costs and payouts to demonstrate the agency model.

|**Your license cost**|**$100 per month**|
|:---|:---|
|Azure usage cost (D1/1-Core)|Billed directly to the publisher, not the customer|
|Customer is billed by Microsoft|$100.00 per month (Publisher must account for any incurred or pass-through infrastructure costs in the license fee)|

|**Microsoft bills**|**$100 per month**|
|:---|:---|
|Microsoft pays you 80% of your license cost <br>**For qualified SaaS apps, Microsoft pays 90% of your license cost*|$80.00 per month <br>*$* 90.00 per month*|

- In this example, Microsoft bills $100.00 to the customer for your software license and pays out $80.00 to the publisher.
- Partners who have qualified for the **Reduced Marketplace Service Fee** will see a reduced transaction fee on the SaaS offers from May 2019 until June 2020. In this scenario, Microsoft bills $100.00 for your software license and pays out $90.00 to the publisher.

> [!NOTE]
> **Reduced Marketplace Service Fee**: For certain SaaS offers that you have published on our Commercial Marketplace, Microsoft will reduce its Marketplace Service Fee from 20% (as described in the Microsoft Publisher Agreement) to 10%. In order for your offer to qualify, at least one of your offers must have been designated by Microsoft as being either IP co-sell ready or IP co-sell prioritized.  Eligibility must be met at least five (5) business days before the end of each calendar month in order to receive this reduced Marketplace Service Fee for the month.  The Reduced Marketplace Service Fee does not apply to VMs, Managed Apps or any other products made available through our Commercial Marketplace.  The Reduced Marketplace Service Fee will only be available to qualified offers for license charges collected by Microsoft between May 1, 2019 and June 30, 2020.  After this time, the Marketplace Service Fee will return to its normal amount. 

### <a name="list-through-microsoft"></a>List through Microsoft

Promote your business with Microsoft by creating a marketplace listing. Selecting to list your offer only and not transact through Microsoft means that Microsoft doesn't participate directly in software license transactions. There is no associated transaction fee and the publisher keeps 100% of any software licensing fees collected from the customer. However, the publisher is responsible for supporting all aspects of the software license transaction, including but not limited to: order fulfillment, metering, billing, invoicing, payment, and collection. 

- **How do you want potential customers to interact with this listing offer?**

##### <a name="get-it-now-free"></a>Get it now (free)
List your offer to customers for free by providing a valid URL (beginning with *http* or *https*) where they can access your app.  Por exemplo: `https://contoso.com/saas-app`

##### <a name="free-trial-listing"></a>Free trial (listing)
List your offer to customers with a link to a free trial by providing a valid URL (beginning with *http* or *https*), where they can get a trial through [one-click authentication by using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/marketplace-saas-applications-technical-publishing-guide#using-azure-active-directory-to-enable-trials).  Por exemplo: `https://contoso.com/trial/saas-app`. Offer listing free trials are created, managed, and configured by your service and do not have subscriptions managed by Microsoft.

> [!NOTE]
> The tokens your application will receive through your trial link can only be used to obtain user information through Azure AD to automate account creation in your app. Microsoft Accounts (MSA) are not supported for authentication using this token.

##### <a name="contact-me"></a>Contactem-me
Collect customer contact information by connecting your Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. The customer will be asked for permission to share their information. These customer details, along with the offer name, ID, and marketplace source where they found your offer, will be sent to the CRM system that you've configured. For more information about configuring your CRM, see [Connect lead management](#connect-lead-management).

## <a name="properties"></a>Propriedades
The **Properties** tab asks you to define the categories and industries used to group your offer on the marketplaces, the legal contracts supporting your offer, and your app version. 

Select **Save** after completing these fields. 

### <a name="category"></a>Categoria
Select a minimum of one (1) and a maximum of three (3) categories used for grouping your offer into the appropriate marketplace search areas. Please call out how your offer supports these categories in the offer description.

[!INCLUDE [Industry Taxonomy](./includes/industry-taxonomy.md)]

### <a name="app-version"></a>VersÃ£o da aplicaÃ§Ã£o
This is an optional field used in the AppSource marketplace to identify the version number of your offer. 

### <a name="standard-contract"></a>Contrato Standard

- **Use Standard Contract?**

To simplify the procurement process for customers and reduce legal complexity for software vendors, Microsoft offers a Standard Contract template in order to help facilitate a transaction in the marketplace. 

Rather than crafting custom terms and conditions, Azure Marketplace publishers can choose to offer their software under the Standard Contract, which customers only need to vet and accept once. 

The Standard Contract can be found here: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2041178.

#### <a name="terms-of-use"></a>Termos de utilizaÃ§Ã£o

If your license terms are different from the Standard Contract, you can elect to enter your own legal terms of use here. These can be entered as plain text or as a single URL linking to your license terms.

Customers are required to accept these terms before they can try your app. 

Remember to **Save** before moving on to the next section!

## <a name="offer-listing"></a>Offer listing

The Offer listing tab displays the languages (and markets) where your offer is available, currently English (United States) is the only location available. Additionally, this page displays the status of the language-specific listing and the date/time that it was added. You will need to define the marketplace details (offer name, description, search terms, etc.) for each language / market.

> [!NOTE]
> Offer listing content (such as offer description, documents, screenshots, terms of use and privacy policy) is not required to be in English as long as the offer description begins with the phrase, "This application is available only in [non-English language]." It is also acceptable to provide a *Useful Link URL* to offer content in a language other than the one used in the Offer listing content.

### <a name="offer-listings"></a>Offer listings

Provide details to be displayed in the marketplace, including descriptions of your offer and marketing assets.

- **Name** (required): The name defined here will appear as the title of your offer listing on the marketplace(s) you have chosen. The name is prepopulated based on your previous **New offer** entry.  This may be trademarked.  This must not contain emojis (unless they are the trademark and copyright symbols) and must be limited to 50 characters.
- **Summary** (required): Provide a short description of your offer to be used in marketplace listing(s) search results. Up to 100 characters of text can be entered in this field.
- **Description** (required): Provide a description of your offer to be displayed in the marketplace listing(s) overview. Consider including a value proposition, key benefits, any category or industry associations, in-app purchase opportunities, any required disclosures, and a link to learn more.
Up to 3,000 characters of text can be entered in this field. For additional tips, see the article [Write a great app description](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/publish/write-a-great-app-description).
- **Search keywords**: Enter up to three search keywords that customers can use to find your offer in the marketplace(s).
- **Getting started instructions** (required): Explain how to configure and start using your app for potential customers.  This quickstart can contain links to more detailed online documentation. Up to 3,000 characters of text can be entered in this field. 

#### <a name="description"></a>**DescriÃ§Ã£o**

This is a required field. Items to include in the description: 

* Clearly describe your offer's value proposition in the first few sentences of your description.  
* Keep in mind that the first few sentences might be displayed in search engine results.  
* Do not rely on features and functionality to sell your product. Instead, focus on the value you deliver.  
* Use industry-specific vocabulary or benefit-based wording as much as possible. 

Core components of your value proposition should include the following information: 

* Description of the product. 
* Type of user that benefits from the product. 
* Customer needs or pain that the product addresses. 

To make your offer description more engaging you can use HTML tags to format the description. 

1. If you want to create paragraphs, add `<p>` at the begging of the text and add `</p>` at the end.

    **Example**: 

    `<p>` This is my first paragraph. `</p>` <br>
    `<p>` This is my second paragraph. `</p>` <br>

    The above would look like this:

    <p> This is my first paragraph. </p>
    <p> This is my second paragraph. </p>

1. If you want to add a **bulleted list of items**, place your text within the `<li>` tags below. You can copy and paste more bulleted items (items between the `<li>` and `</li>` tags) within the `<ul>` and `</ul>` tags. Make sure you add the `<ul></ul>`. 

    **Example**:

    ```
    <ul> 
        <li>add text here</li> 
        <li> add text here </li> 
        <li> add text here </li> 
    </ul> 
    ```

    The above would look like this:
    <ul> 
        <li>add text here</li> 
        <li> add text here </li> 
        <li> add text here </li> 
    </ul> 

1. To **bold** content, add `<b>` at the beginning of the text you want to bold and add `</b>` at the end of the text you want to bold. 

    **Example**: `<b>` FREE TRIAL `</b>`
    
    The above would cause the words FREE TRIAL to be bolded in the description of the offer in the storefront. 

    **FREE TRIAL**

1. To add **line breaks** between your content, add `<br>` before the content that you want to start on a new line. If you want to leave a space and make sure content starts on a new line, add `<br><br>` before the content. 

    **Example**:

    This is a text line. `<br>` This is a text line that will start in a new line. `<br><br>` This is a line that will start two lines below. 

    The above would look like this:

    This is a text line. <br> This is a text line that will start in a new line. <br><br> This is a line that will start two lines below. 

1. If you want to **increase the size of the text**, first choose how big you want the text to be. Use the below examples. After you have selected the size of the text, add the corresponding `<H*></H*>` tags to the beginning and ending of the text. 

    **Example**:

    `<h1>`This is heading 1`</h1>` <br>
    `<h2>`This is heading 2`</h2>` <br>
    `<h3>`This is heading 3`</h3>` <br>
    `<h4>`This is heading 4`</h4>` <br>
    `<h5>`This is heading 5`</h5>` <br>
    `<h6>`This is heading 6`</h6>` 

    The above would look like this:

    ![Sample headings](./media/heading.png)

#### <a name="links"></a>LigaÃ§Ãµes

- **Privacy Policy** (required): Link to your organization's privacy policy. You are responsible for ensuring your app complies with privacy laws and regulations, and for providing a valid privacy policy
- **CSP Program Marketing Materials** (optional): You must provide a link to marketing materials if you choose to extend your offer to the [Cloud Solution Provider (CSP)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/cloud-solution-providers) program. CSP extends your offer to a broader range of qualified customers by enabling CSP partners to bundle, market, and resell your offer. These resellers will need access to materials for marketing your offer. For more information, see [Go-To-Market Services](https://partner.microsoft.com/reach-customers/gtm).
- **Useful Links** (optional): Optional supplemental online documents about your app or related services listed by providing a **Title**  and  **URL**. Add additional useful links by clicking  **+ Add a URL**.

- [Best practices for marketplace offer listings](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/gtm-offer-listing-best-practices)

## <a name="preview"></a>PrÃ©-visualizaÃ§Ã£o

The **Preview** tab enables you to define a limited **Preview Audience** for releasing your offer prior to publishing your offer live to the broader marketplace audience.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must select **Go live** before your offer will be published live to the marketplace public audience after checking your offer in Preview.

- **Define a Preview Audience: Add a single AAD/MSA account email per line, along with an optional description.**

Add up to ten (10) email addresses manually, or twenty (20) if uploading a CSV file, for existing Microsoft Account (MSA) or Azure Active Directory accounts to help with validating your offer before publishing live. By adding these accounts, you are defining an audience that will be allowed preview access to your offer before it is published to the marketplace(s). If your offer is already live, you may still define a preview audience for testing any changes or updates to your offer.

> [!NOTE]
> The preview audience differs from a private audience. A preview audience is allowed access to your offer _prior_ to being published live in the marketplaces. You may also choose to create a plan and make it available only to a private audience. In the **plan listing** tab, you can define a private audience with the **This is a private plan** checkbox. You can then define a private audience of up to 20,000 customers using Azure Tenant IDs.

## <a name="technical-configuration"></a>Technical configuration

The **Technical configuration** tab defines the technical details (URL path, webhook, tenant ID, and app ID) used to connect to your offer. This connection enables us to provision your offer for the end customer if they choose to acquire it. Diagrams describing the usage of the collected fields are available in documentation for [SaaS fulfillment APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/pc-saas-fulfillment-api-v2).

- **Landing page URL** (required): Define the site URL that customers will land on after acquiring your offer from the marketplace. This URL will be the endpoint that receives a token when a customer is routed to the page. That token can be exchanged for provisioning details using resolve in the fulfillment APIs. Those details and any others you collect can be used as part of a customer-interactive web page built in your experience to complete registration and activate their purchase.

- **Connection webhook** (required): For all asynchronous events that Microsoft needs to send to you on behalf of the customer (example: SaaS Subscription has gone invalid), we require you to provide a connection webhook. If you don't already have a webhook system in place, the simplest configuration is to have an HTTP Endpoint Logic App that will listen for any events being posted to it and then handle them appropriately (e.g. https:\//prod-1westus.logic.azure.com:443/work). For more information, see [Call, trigger, or nest workflows with HTTP endpoints in logic apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-http-endpoint).

- **Azure AD tenant ID** (required): Inside Azure portal, we require that you [create an Azure Active Directory (AD) app](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal) so that we can validate the connection between our two services is behind an authenticated communication. To find the [tenant ID](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#get-values-for-signing-in), go to your Azure Active Directory and select **Properties**, then look for the **Directory ID** number listed (e.g. 50c464d3-4930-494c-963c-1e951d15360e).

- **Azure AD app ID** (required): You also need your [application ID](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#get-values-for-signing-in) and an authentication key. To get those values, go to your Azure Active Directory and select **App registrations**, then look for the **Application ID** number listed (e.g. 50c464d3-4930-494c-963c-1e951d15360e). To find the authentication key, go to **Settings** and select **Keys**. You will need to provide a description and duration and will then be provided a number value.

 Note that the Azure application ID is associated to your publisher ID, so make sure that the same application ID is used in all your offers.

## <a name="plan-overview"></a>Plan overview

The **Plan overview** tab enables you to provide a variety of plan options within the same offer. These plans (sometimes referred to as SKUs) could differ in terms of version, monetization, or tiers of service. You must set up at least one plan in order to sell your offer in the marketplace.

Once created, you will see your plan names, IDs, pricing models, availability (Public or Private), current publishing status, and any available actions.

**Actions** available in the **Plan overview** vary depending on the current status of your plan and may include:

- If the plan status is **Draft** - Delete draft
- If the plan status is **Live** - Stop sell plan or Sync private audience

**Create new plan** (minimum of one plan for those who select to sell through Microsoft)

- **Plan ID:** Create a unique plan ID for each plan in this offer. This ID will be visible to customers in the product URL and Azure Resource Manager templates (if applicable). Use only lowercase, alphanumeric characters, dashes or underscores. A maximum of 50 characters are allowed for this plan ID. Note that the ID cannot be modified after selecting create.
- **Plan name:** Customers will see this name when deciding which plan to select within your offer. Create a unique offer name for each plan in this offer. The plan name is used to differentiate software plans that may be a part of the same offer (E.g. Offer name: Windows Server; plans: Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2019).

### <a name="plan-listing"></a>Plan listing

The **plan listing** tab displays the languages (and markets) where your plan is available, currently English (United States) is the only location available. Additionally, this page displays the status of the language-specific listing and the date/time that it was added. You will need to define the marketplace details (offer name, description, search terms, etc.) for each language / market.

#### <a name="plan-listing-details"></a>Plan listing details

Selecting one of the plan languages will display the **plan listing** information, including **Name** and **Description.**

- **Name**: Pre-populated based on your preview **New plan** entry and will appear as the title of your offer's "Software plan" displayed in the marketplace.
- **Description:** This description is an opportunity to explain what makes this software plan unique and any differences from other software plans within your offer. May contain up to 500 characters.

Select **Save** after completing these fields.

#### <a name="plan-pricing-and-availability"></a>Plan pricing and availability

The **Pricing and availability** tab enables you to configure the markets that this plan will be available in, the desired monetization model, price, and billing term. In addition, you can indicate whether to make the plan visible to everyone or only to specific customers (a private audience).

##### <a name="enabling-free-trials"></a>Enabling Free Trials

SaaS offers through the commercial marketplace enable you to provide a one-month free trial when selling through Microsoft. For all billing models and terms except metered plans, free trials are supported. This option allows customers to have a low-barrier to entry through one month of free access.  If you choose to enable a free trial for plans within your offer, the customer will not be able to convert to a paid subscription before the end of the initial one month period.  During this time, customers purchasing your offer can try out any of the supported plans that have the free trial enabled and convert between them.  The conversion to a paid subscription is done automatically at the end of the term.

>[!Note]
>If the customer chooses to convert to a plan without free trials, the conversion will happen, but the free trial will be lost immediately.  Also, once a customer starts paying for a plan, they can no longer get free trial on the same subscription again, even if they convert to a SKU that does support free trials.

The ability to configure a free trial is available for each plan in your offer. Simply navigate to the Pricing and Availability for each offer and check the box to allow a one-month trial.

>[!Note]
>Once your transactable offer has been published with a free trial it cannot be disabled for that plan. Make sure this setting is correct for the first publish to avoid having to re-create the plan.

To obtain information on customer subscriptions currently participating in a free trial, use the new API property `isFreeTrial`, which will be marked as true or false. See the [SaaS Get Subscription API](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/pc-saas-fulfillment-api-v2#get-subscription) for more information.

>[!Note]
>Free trials are not supported for plans that leverage the marketplace metering service.

#### <a name="markets"></a>Markets

- **Edit markets** (optional)

Every plan must be available in at least one market. Select the checkbox for any market location where you would like to make this plan available. A search box and button for selecting "Tax Remitted" countries, in which Microsoft remits sales and use tax on your behalf, are included to help.

If you have already set prices for your plan in United States Dollars (USD) and add another market location, the price for the new market will be calculated according to the current exchange rates. You should always review the price for each market before publishing. Pricing can be reviewed by using the "Export prices (xlsx)" link after saving your changes.

#### <a name="pricing"></a>PreÃ§os

- **Pricing model**: Flat rate or Seat based

**Flat rate:** Enable access to your offer with a single monthly or annual price flat rate price. This is sometimes referred to as site-based pricing. With this pricing model, you can optionally define metered plans that use the marketplace metering service API to charge customers according to non-standard units.  For more information on metered billing, see [metered billing using the marketplace metering service](./saas-metered-billing.md).

**Per user:** Enable access to your offer with the price based on the number of users accessing the offer or occupying seats. This user-based model enables you to set the minimum and maximum number of users allowed based on the price. This way, different price points can be configured based on the number of users by configuring multiple plans.  These fields are optional. If left unselected, the number of users will be interpreted as not having a limit (min of 1 and max of as many as the system can support). These fields may be edited as part of an update to your plan.

Once published, the billing pricing model choice cannot be changed. In addition, all plans for the same offer must share the same pricing model.

- **Billing term**: Monthly or Annual

Select the frequency that customers must pay the price listed. At least one Monthly or Annual price must be provided, or both options can be made available to customers.

- **Price**: USD per month or USD per year

Prices set in local currency (USD = United States Dollar) are converted into the local currency of all selected markets using the current exchange rates available during setup. Validate these prices before publishing by exporting the pricing spreadsheet and reviewing the price in each market. If you would like to set custom prices in an individual market, modify and import the pricing spreadsheet. You are responsible for validating this pricing and own these settings.
*\*You must first save your pricing changes to enable export of pricing data.*

Review your prices carefully before publishing, as there are some restrictions on what can change after a plan is published:

- Once a plan is published, the pricing model can't be changed.
- Once a billing term is published for a plan, it can't be removed later.
- Once a price for a market in your plan is published, it can't be changed later.

### <a name="plan-audience"></a>Plan Audience

You have the option to configure each plan to be visible to everyone or to only a specific audience of your choosing. You can assign membership in this restricted audience using Azure AD tenant IDs.

#### <a name="privacy"></a>Privacidade

- **This is a private plan** (Optional checkbox)

Check this box to make your plan private and visible only to the restricted audience of your choosing. Once published as a private plan, you can update the audience or choose to make the plan available to everyone. Once a plan is published as visible to everyone, it must remain visible to everyone. (The plan cannot be configured as a private plan again).

- **Restricted Audience (Tenant IDs)**

Assign the audience that will have access to this private plan. Access is assigned using tenant IDs with the option to include a description of each tenant ID assigned. A maximum of 10 tenant IDs can be added, or 20,000 customers tenant IDs if importing a .csv spreadsheet file.

A tenant is a representation of an organization, with an ID represented as a GUID (Globally Unique Identifier, a 128-bit integer number used to identify resources). Ã‰ uma instÃ¢ncia dedicada do Azure AD que uma organizaÃ§Ã£o ou um programador de aplicaÃ§Ãµes recebe quando a organizaÃ§Ã£o ou o programador de aplicaÃ§Ãµes cria uma relaÃ§Ã£o com o Microsoft â€“ como inscrever-se no Azure, no Microsoft Intune ou no Microsoft 365. Cada inquilino do Azure AD Ã© distinto e separado dos outros inquilinos do Azure AD. To check the tenant, sign in to the Azure portal with the account you want to use to manage your application. Se tiver um inquilino, irÃ¡ ter automaticamente sessÃ£o iniciada no mesmo e verÃ¡ o nome do inquilino imediatamente por baixo do nome da sua conta. Se passar com o rato por cima do nome da sua conta, no canto superior direito do portal do Azure, verÃ¡ o seu nome, e-mail, diretÃ³rio e ID de inquilino (um GUID) e o seu domÃ­nio. Se a sua conta estiver associada a vÃ¡rios inquilinos, pode selecionar o nome da sua conta para abrir um menu onde pode alternar entre inquilinos. Cada inquilino tem o seu prÃ³prio ID de inquilino. You can also look up your organization's tenant ID using a domain name URL at:  [https://www.whatismytenantid.com](https://www.whatismytenantid.com).

While SaaS offers use tenant IDs to define a private audience, other offer types may use Azure Subscription IDs (which are also represented as GUIDs).

> [!NOTE]
> The private audience (or restricted audience) differs from a preview audience. In the **[Preview](#preview)** tab, you can define a preview audience. A preview audience is allowed access to your offer *prior* to the offer being published live in the marketplace. While the private audience designation only applies to a specific plan, the preview audience can view all plans (private or not), but only during the limited preview period while the plan is tested and validated.
