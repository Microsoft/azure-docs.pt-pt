This cURL-based quickstart walks you through getting an answer from your knowledge base.

## <a name="prerequisites"></a>Pr√©-requisitos

* Latest [**cURL**](https://curl.haxx.se/).
* You must have a [QnA Maker service](../How-To/set-up-qnamaker-service-azure.md) and have a [knowledge base with questions and answers](../Tutorials/create-publish-query-in-portal.md).

## <a name="publish-to-get-endpoint"></a>Publish to get endpoint

When you are ready to generate an answer to a question from your knowledge base, [publish](../Quickstarts/create-publish-knowledge-base.md#publish-the-knowledge-base) your knowledge base.

## <a name="use-production-endpoint-with-curl"></a>Use production endpoint with cURL

When your knowledge base is published, the **Publish** page displays the HTTP request settings to generate an answer. The **CURL** tab shows the settings required to generate an answer from the command-line tool, [CURL](https://www.getpostman.com).

1. Edit the question to be relevant to your knowledge base. Be careful not to remove the containing JSON surrounding the question.
1. Enter the command. 
1. The response includes the relevant information about the answer.
