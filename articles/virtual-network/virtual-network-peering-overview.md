# <a name="virtual-network-peering"></a>Peering de rede virtual

Virtual network peering enables you to seamlessly connect networks in [Azure Virtual Network](virtual-networks-overview.md). The virtual networks appear as one for connectivity purposes. The traffic between virtual machines uses the Microsoft backbone infrastructure. Like traffic between virtual machines in the same network, traffic is routed through Microsoft's *private* network only.

Azure supports the following types of peering:

* Virtual network peering: Connect virtual networks within the same Azure region.
* Global virtual network peering: Connecting virtual networks across Azure regions.

As vantagens da utilização do peering de redes virtuais, sejam locais ou globais, incluem:

* Uma ligação de baixa latência e largura de banda alta entre os recursos em redes virtuais diferentes.
* The ability for resources in one virtual network to communicate with resources in a different virtual network.
* The ability to transfer data between virtual networks across Azure subscriptions, Azure Active Directory tenants, deployment models, and Azure regions.
* The ability to peer virtual networks created through the Azure Resource Manager.
* The ability to peer a virtual network created through Resource Manager to one created through the classic deployment model. Para saber mais sobre os modelos de implementação do Azure, veja [Understand Azure deployment models](../azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-deployment-model.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json) (Compreender os modelos de implementação do Azure).
* Sem períodos de indisponibilidade para recursos em qualquer rede virtual durante ou após a criação do peering.

O tráfego de rede entre redes virtuais em modo de peering é privado. O tráfego entre as redes virtuais é mantido na rede principal da Microsoft. Não é necessária Internet pública, gateways ou encriptação na comunicação entre as redes virtuais.

## <a name="connectivity"></a>Ligação

For peered virtual networks, resources in either virtual network can directly connect with resources in the peered virtual network.

A latência de rede entre máquinas virtuais em redes virtuais no modo de peering na mesma região é igual à latência numa rede virtual individual. O débito de rede baseia-se na largura de banda que é permitida para a máquina virtual proporcionalmente ao respetivo tamanho. Não existe qualquer restrição adicional na largura de banda no peering.

O tráfego entre as máquinas virtuais nas redes virtuais em modo de peering é encaminhado diretamente através da infraestrutura principal da Microsoft e não através de um gateway ou numa Internet pública.

You can apply network security groups in either virtual network to block access to other virtual networks or subnets.
When configuring virtual network peering, either open or close the network security group rules between the virtual networks. If you open full connectivity between peered virtual networks, you can apply network security groups to block or deny specific access. Full connectivity is the default option. To learn more about network security groups, see [Security groups](security-overview.md).

## <a name="service-chaining"></a>Encadeamento de serviços

Service chaining enables you to direct traffic from one virtual network to a virtual appliance or gateway in a peered network through user-defined routes.

To enable service chaining, configure user-defined routes that point to virtual machines in peered virtual networks as the *next hop* IP address. User-defined routes could also point to virtual network gateways to enable service chaining.

You can deploy hub-and-spoke networks, where the hub virtual network hosts infrastructure components such as a network virtual appliance or VPN gateway. Todas as redes virtuais “spoke” podem, então, configurar o peering com a rede virtual do concentrador. Traffic flows through network virtual appliances or VPN gateways in the hub virtual network.

O peering de rede virtual permite que o próximo salto numa rota definida pelo utilizador seja o endereço IP de uma máquina virtual na rede virtual em modo de peering ou um gateway VPN. You can't route between virtual networks with a user-defined route that specifies an Azure ExpressRoute gateway as the next hop type. Para saber mais sobre as rotas definidas pelo utilizador, veja [Descrição geral das rotas definidas pelo utilizador](virtual-networks-udr-overview.md#user-defined). To learn how to create a hub and spoke network topology, see [Hub-spoke network topology in Azure](/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/hybrid-networking/hub-spoke?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json).

## <a name="gateways-and-on-premises-connectivity"></a>Gateways e conetividade no local

Each virtual network, including a peered virtual network, can have its own gateway. A virtual network can use its gateway to connect to an on-premises network. You can also configure [virtual network-to-virtual network connections](../vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-vnet-vnet-rm-ps.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json) by using gateways, even for peered virtual networks.

When you configure both options for virtual network interconnectivity, the traffic between the virtual networks flows through the peering configuration. The traffic uses the Azure backbone.

You can also configure the gateway in the peered virtual network as a transit point to an on-premises network. In this case, the virtual network that is using a remote gateway can't have its own gateway. A virtual network has only one gateway. The gateway is either a local or remote gateway in the peered virtual network, as shown in the following diagram:

![trânsito de peering de rede virtual](./media/virtual-networks-peering-overview/local-or-remote-gateway-in-peered-virual-network.png)

Both virtual network peering and global virtual network peering support gateway transit.

Gateway transit between virtual networks created through different deployment models is supported. The gateway must be in the virtual network in the Resource Manager model. Para saber mais sobre como utilizar um gateway para trânsito, veja [Configurar um gateway de VPN para trânsito num peering de rede virtual](../vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-peering-gateway-transit.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json).

When you peer virtual networks that share a single Azure ExpressRoute connection, the traffic between them goes through the peering relationship. That traffic uses the Azure backbone network. Pode continuar a utilizar gateways locais em cada rede virtual para ligar ao circuito no local. Otherwise, you can use a shared gateway and configure transit for on-premises connectivity.

## <a name="troubleshoot"></a>Resolução de problemas

To confirm that virtual networks are peered, you can check effective routes. Check routes for a network interface in any subnet in a virtual network. Se um peering de rede virtual existe, todas as sub-redes na rede virtual têm rotas com o tipo de salto seguinte *VNet peering*, para cada espaço de endereços em cada virtual rede peered. For more information, see [Diagnose a virtual machine routing problem](diagnose-network-routing-problem.md).

You can also troubleshoot connectivity to a virtual machine in a peered virtual network using Azure Network Watcher. A connectivity check lets you see how traffic is routed from a source virtual machine's network interface to a destination virtual machine's network interface. For more information, see [Troubleshoot connections with Azure Network Watcher using the Azure portal](../network-watcher/network-watcher-connectivity-portal.md#check-connectivity-to-a-virtual-machine).

You can also try the [Troubleshoot virtual network peering issues](virtual-network-troubleshoot-peering-issues.md).

## Constraints for peered virtual networks<a name="requirements-and-constraints"></a>

The following constraints apply only when virtual networks are globally peered:

* Resources in one virtual network can't communicate with the front-end IP address of a Basic Internal Load Balancer (ILB)  in a globally peered virtual network.
* Some services that use a Basic load balancer don't work over global virtual network peering. For more information, see [What are the constraints related to Global VNet Peering and Load Balancers?](virtual-networks-faq.md#what-are-the-constraints-related-to-global-vnet-peering-and-load-balancers).

For more information, see [Requirements and constraints](virtual-network-manage-peering.md#requirements-and-constraints). To learn more about the supported number of peerings, see [Networking limits](../azure-subscription-service-limits.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#azure-resource-manager-virtual-networking-limits).

## <a name="permissions"></a>Permissões

To learn about permissions required to create a virtual network peering, see [Permissions](virtual-network-manage-peering.md#permissions).

## <a name="pricing"></a>Preços

There's a nominal charge for ingress and egress traffic that uses a virtual network peering connection. For more information, see [Virtual Network pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-network).

Gateway Transit is a peering property that enables a virtual network to utilize a VPN/ExpressRoute gateway in a peered virtual network. Gateway transit works for both cross premises and network-to-network connectivity. Traffic to the gateway (ingress or egress) in the peered virtual network incurs virtual network peering charges. For more information, see [VPN Gateway pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/vpn-gateway/) for VPN gateway charges and ExpressRoute Gateway pricing for ExpressRoute gateway charges.

>[!NOTE]
> A previous version of this document stated that virtual network peering charges would not apply with Gateway Transit. It now reflects accurate pricing per the pricing page.
